                <p>Over the past few weeks, states with already restrictive abortion laws have exploited the COVID-19 pandemic to further limit or outright ban abortion care. Under the guise of protecting public health and reserving medical resources and personnel for the pandemic, state governors, attorneys general, and state departments of health have issued orders that label abortion care as elective and non-essential. Some high profile battles over reproductive rights are well documented, but abortion availability remains unclear in most parts of the country. </p>
                <p>We believe that all forms of reproductive healthcare are essential. We also believe that it is a person’s right to know whether abortion services are available and safely accessible in their state. This website aims to provide clear and up-to-date information regarding abortion access during the COVID-19 pandemic. <strong>We have produced three maps that illustrate the impact of restrictive abortion laws since the outbreak (1), the initial definition of abortion services as essential or non-essential in executive orders and early statements (2), and the current status of abortion availability (3).</strong> Although many states have started to reopen, we believe that continuous tracking of abortion availability and accessibility is vital. </p>

                  <p>The COVID-19 Abortion Restriction Score is a composite score indicating the number of medically unnecessary restrictive laws enacted in each state. The effects of these restrictions on access to abortion care are amplified in the context of the pandemic. A Center for Reproductive Rights <a target="_blank" href="http://reproductiverights.org/sites/default/files/documents/COVID-19%20Underscores%20the%20Nonessential%20Nature%20of%20Abortion%20Restrictions.pdf">article</a> provides an extensive list of these laws and their potential impacts. We isolated the four restrictive laws that most affected abortion access during the COVID-19 pandemic and combined them to form the composite score. Those include:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                  <li><strong>Two trip requirement for an abortion.</strong> <p>Some states require a person to travel to the abortion clinic twice – once for counselling and in some cases tests or ultrasounds, and another for the procedure itself. This increases a person's risk of contracting and spreading the virus. Furthermore, the arrangements necessary to attend two in-person appointments, place an increased burden on a person seeking abortion services in pandemic conditions (e.g. restrictions on travel, difficulty arranging and affording childcare, a place to stay, fear of placing family at risk of contracting COVID-19, etc.).</p><p>A state received a score of 3 if they require two trips for an abortion and a score of 0 if they do not have this requirement. Data for this restriction were acquired from the Guttmacher Institute’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/counseling-and-waiting-periods-abortion">data</a> on Counseling and Waiting Periods for Abortion.</p></li>
                  <li><strong>Telemedicine ban for abortion.</strong> <p>When telemedicine is banned, people are unable to access abortion services from home and are required to come to the clinic in person. This increases the risk of contracting and spreading the virus. The arrangements necessary to attend an in-person appointment place an increased burden on a person seeking abortion services in pandemic conditions (e.g. restrictions on travel, difficulty arranging and affording childcare, a place to stay, fear of placing family at risk of contracting COVID-19, etc.).</p><p> A state received a score of 3 if telemedicine banned for abortion and a score of 0 if telemedicine is legal. Data for this restriction were acquired from the Guttmacher Institute’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/article_files/hostile_and_supportive_state_abortion_laws_1-24-2020.pdf">Hostilility Index for Abortion</a>.</p></li>
                  <li><strong>Restrictions limiting ability of providers to delegate tasks.</strong> <p>Some states require that the attending physician be present throughout the entirety of a patient’s care cycle, including counseling appointments. This diverts essential capacity that could be directed towards the care of other patients to the delivery of medically unnecessary consultations. This further diminishes already reduced clinic capacity brought about by COVID-19 policy changes.</p><p>A state received a score of 3 if counselling and state mandated counselling has to be provided by the attending or referring physician. A state received a score of 2 if counselling has to be done by an attending or referring physician but state mandated counselling can be done by any health professional or online. A state received a score of 1 if counselling and state mandated counselling can be done by any health professional. Finally a state received a score of 0 if no biased counselling is required. Data for this restriction were collected from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.prochoiceamerica.org/laws-policy/state-government/">NARAL Pro Choice</a>.</p></li>
                  <li><strong>Medication abortions must be administered in the presence of a physician.</strong><p> Some states require that medication abortions be administered under the supervision of the attending physician. This requirement prevents a person from accessing abortion services from home and instead requires her to come to the clinic in person. This increases her risk of contracting and spreading the virus. Furthermore, this law diverts essential physician capacity away from the care of other patients.
                  </p><p> A state received a score of 3 if medication abortions need to be administered in the presence of a physician and a score of 0 if this is not required. Data for this restriction were acquired from the Guttmacher Institute’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/medication-abortion">data on Medication Abortion</a>.</p></li>
                  </ol>                 
                  <p>To calculate the composite COVID-19 Abortion Restriction Score, we first weighted the values for the variables assessing the restrictions limiting providers to delegate tasks and the requirement of a physician to be present for the administration of medication abortion by 0.5. We decided to weight these values as we believe that the other two variables have a more significant impact on a person's ability to access care during a pandemic, while the provider restrictions have more of an impact on facility capacity to provide services. We then added the weighted values of the restrictions for each state. Abortion services are more difficult to access in states with higher COVID-19 restriction scores than in states with lower scores. Though the restrictions used in the composite score were enacted to restrict abortion access before the pandemic, the effects of these restrictions are amplified in pandemic conditions.                  </p>

                  <p>The data for this map were collected using state government executive orders, press releases, and other news articles and analysis tracking whether abortion services are considered essential services during COVID-19. We classified each state into the following four categories according to the language used in their initial government order or official statement to the press in which essential and non-essential services were designated.</p>
                  <ol>
                  <li>Explicitly defines abortion services as non-essential</li>
                  <li>Does not explicitly define abortion services as essential or non-essential but leaves the decision up to the medical provider</li>
                  <li>Does not explicitly define abortion services as essential or non-essential</li>
                  <li>Explicitly defines abortion services as essential</li>  </ol>                
                    <p>This map demonstrates the necessity for explicit language indicating that abortion services are essential. Any ambiguity around this definition can be used by anti-abortion activists and government officials alike to restrict abortion access during the pandemic. We recorded each state’s designation in their initial government order, regardless of whether amendments to this designation were made. Initial designation highlights the level of priority given to reproductive health services and rights.                    </p>

                  <p>The data for this map were collected using news articles tracking the availability of abortion services across the US, abortion clinic websites, and abortion access fund and network pages. According to this data we classified each state into the following four categories:</p>
                  <ol>
                  <li>Abortion services (surgical and medication) are unavailable or banned</li>
                  <li>Surgical abortion is banned or extreme abortion restrictions exist</li>
                  <li>Abortion services are available but under threat or their availability is unclear (initially banned but was blocked and/or relevant history of anti-abortion actions)</li>
                  <li>Abortion services are available</li></ol>
                    <p>For some states, no reliable data was found regarding the availability of abortion services. We classified these states as unclear and in the same category as states where abortion services are available but under threat. A lack of clear messaging regarding abortion service availability greatly impacts a person’s ability to access these services. This map provides up-to-date information regarding the availability of abortion across the US and draws attention to states where, although abortion might currently be available, access to care is under threat.</p>

          <p>Abortion care is   <strong>currently unavailable and inaccessible</strong>. The state has a COVID-19 abortion restriction score of 8 [high].</p>
          <p>Arkansas defines abortion as a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/22/arkansas-abortion-coronavirus-court-ruling">non-essential service</a> during COVID-19. The only clinic providing procedural abortions in the state was ordered to stop providing services during the pandemic. A federal appeals court upheld this ban on most abortions on April 22. As of May 27, the clinic has <a target="_blank" href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2020/may/27/lr-clinic-pulls-suit-on-testing-2020052/">dropped the lawsuit</a>, but the scarce availability of tests makes access to surgical abortions in the state uncertain.</p>
          <p>Despite plans to start reopening salons and other services in the state on May 6, the state issued an <a target="_blank" href=" https://www.healthy.arkansas.gov/images/uploads/pdf/ResumeElectiveSurgeryDirectiveFINAL4.23.20.pdf">order</a>, stating that those seeking elective surgeries must have at least one negative COVID-19 NAAT test within 48 hours prior to the beginning of the procedure. On May 7, a federal judge <a target="_blank" href="https://apnews.com/ffff1417b388d59c41380629c554c9e2"> denied the request</a> from the only clinic able to provide abortions to block this testing rule. Due to the lack of test availability, the ruling effectively bans access to abortion in the state. </p>
          <p>Arkansas’ testing rule has been recently modified, now requiring a negative test within 72 hours of the procedure instead of within 48 hours, as previously required. Despite a federal judge’s May 7 denial of the clinic’s request that the abortion clinic be exused from this rule, the Little Rock Family Planning Services clinic is still <a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2020/may/19/state-asks-to-dismiss-surgeries-challen-1/">requesting a permanent injunction</a>. As of May 27, the clinic has <a target="_blank" href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2020/may/27/lr-clinic-pulls-suit-on-testing-2020052/">dropped the lawsuit</a>, but the scarce availability of tests makes access to surgical abortions in the state uncertain.</p>

Although the governor does not explicitly reference abortion care in his statement, the state’s attorney general provided a <a target="_blank" href="https://dems.ag/daga-dem-ags-statements-on-protecting-repro-health-care-during-covid-19/">statement</a> included in a press release from the Democratic Attorneys General Association assuring that access to abortion care would be protected during the pandemic.</p>
          <p>On April 24, Governor Jared Polis announced a lifting of Colorado's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage">stay at home order</a> instituting a “safer at home approach.” This enables the lifting of restrictions on retail business and, since May 1, personal care businesses.</p>

However, Attorney General Jeff Landry has been <a target="_blank" href="https://rewire.news/article/2020/04/14/abortion-access-covid-states/#louisiana">working to convince</a> the Louisiana health department that abortions are elective procedures that should be banned during the COVID-19 crisis.

          <p>Texas has been at the forefront of the movement to restrict abortion during the pandemic. Governor Greg Abbott’s original March 22 <a target="_blank" href="https://lrl.texas.gov/scanned/govdocs/Greg%20Abbott/2020/GA-09.pdf">executive order</a> banned all non-essential medical procedures, classifying abortions as non-essential.

The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2020/04/federal-appeals-court-upholds-texas-abortion-ban-during-covid-19-pandemic/">upheld the ban</a>, though it <a target="_blank" href="https://rewire.news/article/2020/04/14/abortion-access-covid-states/#texas">expired on April 21</a>.</p>
          <p>Abortion is now available in Texas, as Texas’ <a target="_blank" href="https://rewire.news/article/2020/04/14/abortion-access-covid-states/#texas">new order</a> has exemptions for providers that do not use hospital beds or request personal protective equipment, and the state has agreed that abortion providers fall into this category.</p>
          <p>Governor Abbott began reopening certain businesses in the state on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-coronavirus-trnd/">May 8</a>. </p>
